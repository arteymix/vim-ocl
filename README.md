vim-ocl
=======
Highlights Object Constraint Language (OCL) syntax.

It has a very basic support for now, but I will improve it as I learn vim syntax
scripting.

Installation
------------
I recommend Pathogen if you are proficient with git:
```bash
cd ~/.vim
git submodule add https://github.com/arteymix/vim-ocl.git bundle/vim-ocl
```
